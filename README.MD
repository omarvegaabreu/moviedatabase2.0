### MOVIE DATABASE 2.0

Javascript application which is used to add and search for your favorite movie. This application was built in order to understand the basic core concepts of JS Object literals: Manipulating Object elements, doing shallow copies of arrays by using the spread operator among others. This application also helped me to fully understand basic methods like: Array.filter(), Array.map(), for of loops, and assigning global variable as object keys and values.

### Usage

Once you load the page:

2. Type the name of your favorite movie.
1. Click on the add movie button.
1. Once the movie is added you can search for the movie.

Note:A delete option was not added since this is not the intended use of the application, however adding the functionality is an option for the future, in the 3.0 version.
